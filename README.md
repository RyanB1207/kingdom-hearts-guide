# Kingdom Hearts Collectibles
A portable guide I made back in 2012 when playing through the original Kingdom Hearts for probably the fourth time, and got sick of loading GameFAQs throughout.

I deployed this mini-site to my local intranet so I could load it on mobile or desktop (basically wherever the PS2 was set up).

It contains the following:

* Trinities
    * By location
    * By color
    * Trinity learn locations
* Dalmations
    * By location
    * By number
    * Dalmation reward groups
* Clock tower rewards for different times
* Item synthesis
    * Synthesis requirements
    * Item sources
* Introduction
    * Path-choosing bonuses (sword, wand, shield)
        * Ability progression
    * Adventure begins stats (dawn, midday, dusk)
